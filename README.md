## Problem Statement

### Overview
This project endeavors to investigate various methodologies for the implementation of an **Information Retrieval (IR)-based Question Answering Chatbot**, as a crucial component of my research and studies in natural language communication. The high level view of the architecture of the information retrieval system is as follows:

- The model performs indexing at the paragraph level rather than the document level. This allows the model to provide more fine-grained results based on user questions.
- The model calculates similarity scores between a query vector and stored data using three distinct mechanisms, namely:

&nbsp;&nbsp;**(1) Traditional TF-IDF computation**

&nbsp;&nbsp;**(2) Consine Similarity**

&nbsp;&nbsp;**(3) BM25 Score Function**
